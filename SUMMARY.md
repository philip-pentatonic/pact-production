# PACT Production System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built
A standalone production system for PACT recycling management, extracted from the pentatonic-demo repository.

## Key Changes from Original
1. **Authentication**: Replaced Clerk authentication with JWT-based username/password system
2. **Database**: Migrated from Clerk-based users to standalone user management
3. **Frontend**: Used the actual PACT admin dashboard from pentatonic-demo
4. **API Endpoints**: Implemented all missing endpoints needed by the dashboard

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with Hono framework
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Authentication**: JWT with PBKDF2 password hashing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Current URLs
- **API**: https://pact-api.philip-134.workers.dev
- **Dashboard**: https://pact-dashboard.pages.dev

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Set up clean repository structure
- ✅ Implement JWT authentication to replace Clerk
- ✅ Create database schema and seed data
- ✅ Deploy backend to Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages
- ✅ Implement all required API endpoints
- ✅ Fix authentication issues
- ✅ Set up CI/CD pipelines

## Known Limitations
1. Frontend currently shows demo data only
2. Manual JWT decoding workaround needed for Cloudflare Workers
3. Password reset functionality not implemented
4. Email notifications not configured

## Security Notes
- JWT secret is properly secured in Cloudflare
- Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with salt
- CORS is configured for production URLs
- All API endpoints require authentication (except /health and /api/public)

## Next Steps for Production Use
1. Import real PACT data
2. Configure custom domains
3. Set up monitoring and alerts
4. Implement backup strategy
5. Add password reset functionality
6. Configure email notifications
